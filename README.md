# WinApps for Linux

Run Windows apps such as Microsoft Office in Linux (Ubuntu/Fedora) and GNOME/KDE as if they were a part of the native OS, including Nautilus integration for right clicking on files of specific mime types to open them.

## How it works and why WinApps exists

Back in April, Hayden Barnes [tweeted](https://twitter.com/unixterminal/status/1255919797692440578?lang=en) what appeared to be native Windows apps in a container or VM inside Ubuntu. However, no details have emerged on how this was accomplished, though it is likely a similar method to this but with an insider build Windows Container.

Rather than wait around for this, WinApps was created as an easy, one command way to include apps running inside a VM (or on any RDP server) directly into GNOME as if they were native applications. WinApps works by:

- Running a Windows RDP server in a background VM container
- Checking the RDP server for installed applications such as Microsoft Office
- If those programs are installed, it creates shortcuts leveraging FreeRDP for both the CLI and the GNOME tray
- Files in your home directory are accessible via the `\\tsclient\home` mount inside the VM
- You can right click on any files in your home directory to open with an application, too

## App support and "To Do"

Note: The app list below is fueled by the community, and therefore many apps may be untested by the WinApps team.

Currently supported apps

- Internet Explorer 11 (just because)
- Microsoft Access (2016)
- Microsoft Access (2019)
- Microsoft Access (Office 365)
- Microsoft Excel (2016)
- Microsoft Excel (2019)
- Microsoft Excel (Office 365)
- Microsoft Word (2016)
- Microsoft Word (2019)
- Microsoft Word (Office 365)
- Microsoft OneNote (2016)
- Microsoft OneNote (2019)
- Microsoft OneNote (Office 365)
- Microsoft Outlook (2016)
- Microsoft Outlook (2019)
- Microsoft Outlook (Office 365)
- Microsoft PowerPoint (2016)
- Microsoft PowerPoint (2019)
- Microsoft PowerPoint (Office 365)
- Microsoft Publisher (2016)
- Microsoft Publisher (2019)
- Microsoft Publisher (Office 365)

To Do

- Add additional app configurations
- Subsystem support: Add a script to remove (and re-add) the Explorer shell and other non-required Windows features to minimize overhead
- Automate the Windows elements of the install

## Installation

### Creating your WinApps configuration file

You will need to create a `~/.config/winapps/winapps.conf` configuration file with the following information in it:

```bash
RDP_USER="MyWindowsUser"
RDP_PASS="MyWindowsPassword"
#RDP_IP="192.168.123.111"
#DEBUG="true"
```

If you are using Option 2 below with a pre-existing non-KVM RDP server, you can use the `RDP_IP` to specify it's location. If you are running a VM in KVM with NAT enabled, leave `RDP_IP` commented out and WinApps will auto-detect the right local IP.

If you enable `DEBUG`, a log will be created on each application start in `~/.local/share/winapps/winapps.log`.

### Option 1 - Running KVM

You can refer to the [KVM](https://www.linux-kvm.org) documentation for specifics, but the first thing you need to do is set up a Virtual Machine running Windows 10 Professional (or any version that supports RDP). First, clone WinApps and install KVM and FreeRDP:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fmstrat/winapps.git
cd winapps
sudo apt-get install -y virt-manager freerdp2-x11
```

Now set up KVM to run as your user instead of root and allow it through AppArmor (for Ubuntu 20.04 and above):

```bash
sudo sed -i "s/#user = "root"/user = "$(id -un)"/g" /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf
sudo sed -i "s/#group = "root"/group = "$(id -gn)"/g" /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf
sudo usermod -a -G kvm $(id -un)
sudo usermod -a -G libvirt $(id -un)
sudo systemctl restart libvirtd
sudo ln -s /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.libvirtd /etc/apparmor.d/disable/

sleep 5

sudo virsh net-autostart default
sudo virsh net-start default
```

**You will likely need to reboot to ensure your current shell is added to the group.**

Next, define a VM called RDPWindows from the sample XML file with:

```bash
virsh define kvm/RDPWindows.xml
virsh autostart RDPWindows
```

You will now want to change any settings on the VM and install Windows and whatever programs you would like, such as Microsoft Office. You can access the VM with:

```bash
virt-manager
```

After the install process, you will want to:

- Go to the Start Menu
  - Type "About"
  - Open "About"
  - Change the PC name to "RDPWindows" (This will allow WinApps to detect the local IP)
- Go to Settings
  - Under "System", then "Remote Desktop" allow remote connections for RDP
- Merge `kvm/RDPApps.reg` into the registry to enable RDP Applications

And the final step is to run the installer:

```bash
$ ./install.sh
[sudo] password for fmstrat:
Installing...
  Checking for installed apps in RDP machine...
  Configuring Excel... Finished.
  Configuring PowerPoint... Finished.
  Configuring Word... Finished.
  Configuring Windows... Finished.
Installation complete.
```

### Option 2 - I already have an RDP server or VM

If you already have an RDP server or VM, using WinApps is very straight forward. Simply create your `~/.config/winapps/winapps.conf` configuration file, and run:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Fmstrat/winapps.git
$ cd winapps
$ sudo apt-get install -y freerdp2-x11
$ ./install.sh
[sudo] password for fmstrat:
Installing...
  Checking for installed apps in RDP machine...
  Configuring Excel... Finished.
  Configuring PowerPoint... Finished.
  Configuring Word... Finished.
  Configuring Windows... Finished.
Installation complete.
```

You will need to make sure RDP Applications are enabled, which can be set by merging in `kvm/RDPApps.reg` into the registry. Copy the file to the Windows desktop, right click, and choose "merge".

If the install script hangs, try running xfreerdp and troubleshooting the connection. One possibility is that remote desktop is not enabled on the Windows side - fix this by going to settings>system>remote desktop and enabling Remote Desktop. Another possibility is that you need to accept a certificate. Once xfreerdp connects accept the cert, re-run the install script and it should complete as expected.

> xfreerdp /u:"_username_" /p:"_password_" /v:"_ipaddress_"

## Adding applications

Adding applications to the installer is easy. Simply copy one of the application configurations in the `apps` folder, and:

- Edit the variables for the application
- Replace the `icon.svg` with an SVG for the application
- Re-run the installer
- Submit a Pull Request to add it to WinApps officially

When running the installer, it will check for if any configured apps are installed, and if they are it will create the appropriate shortcuts on the host OS.

## Checking for new application support

The installer can be run multiple times, so simply run:

```bash
$ git pull
$ ./install.sh
[sudo] password for fmstrat:
Installing...
  Checking for installed apps in RDP machine...
  Configuring Excel... Finished.
  Configuring PowerPoint... Finished.
  Configuring Word... Finished.
  Configuring Windows... Finished.
Installation complete.
```
